# ChunkyPNG - the pure ruby library to access PNG files.
#
# The ChunkyPNG module defines some constants that are used in the
# PNG specification, specifies some exception classes, and serves as 
# a namespace for all the other modules and classes in this library.
#
# {ChunkyPNG::Image}::      class to represent PNG images, including metadata.
# {ChunkyPNG::Canvas}::     class to represent the image's canvas.
# {ChunkyPNG::Color}::      module to work with color values.
# {ChunkyPNG::Palette}::    represents the palette of colors used on a {ChunkyPNG::Canvas}.
# {ChunkyPNG::Datastream}:: represents the internal structure of a PNG {ChunkyPNG::Image}.
# {ChunkyPNG::Color}::      represents one chunk of data within a {ChunkyPNG::Datastream}.
# {ChunkyPNG::Point}::      geometry helper class representing a 2-dimensional point.
# {ChunkyPNG::Dimension}::  geometry helper class representing a dimension (i.e. width x height).
# {ChunkyPNG::Vector}::     geometry helper class representing a series of points.
